Real-life Use Cases of Singleton Pattern 🌍
The Singleton Design Pattern is used in various real-life situations where we want to ensure only one instance of an object. Here are some examples:

• Logging Systems:

As we've already seen, logging systems often use Singleton to ensure that there’s only one logger instance, ensuring consistent logging throughout an application. 📜

‍

• Database Connections:

We often need a single database connection throughout the application to avoid multiple connections that could lead to inefficiency or resource exhaustion. 💻

‍

• Configuration Settings:

Imagine having configuration settings for your application that need to be consistent across the app. Using a Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the settings object exists. ⚙️

‍

• Thread Pooling:

A thread pool manager can also use a Singleton to ensure that the pool is managed efficiently with only one thread pool instance. 🧵
