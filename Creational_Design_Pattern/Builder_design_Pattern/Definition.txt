The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that helps in constructing complex objects step-by-step. This pattern is especially useful when an object has many attributes or optional fields, allowing you to create different configurations of the object easily and clearly.

‍

Instead of using a constructor with many parameters (which can be cumbersome and error-prone), the Builder pattern allows you to separate the construction process from the final object. It allows you to build an object piece by piece, and the final product is assembled only when you call the build() method.

In short, it’s a way to construct an object in a flexible, readable, and maintainable manner.
