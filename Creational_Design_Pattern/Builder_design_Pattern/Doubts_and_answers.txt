1. Why do we need builder design pattern , why can't we just use getters and setters?

Ans. Because there can be some variables in the class which are final and need to be created at the time of creation of object only, so
     they must be sent through a builder, if we don't use builder and pass them in constructor only then in PR reviews it will become         	difficult to understand which value is for which variable.

2. Why do we make a final static builder class in the class which it is building?
Ans. Because the constructors will be private, and only a nested static class can access those.


3. What will happen to the attrbutes not setted by builder?

Ans. They will have a default value initially set in the builder., also there will be no final attributes in builder.
