Let’s review how the Factory Pattern improves our solution:

1. Centralized Object Creation:

The VehicleFactory class handles all the logic of creating vehicles. Now, you only need to call the getVehicle() method with the desired vehicle type, and the factory will take care of the rest. This makes the code much cleaner and easier to maintain. ✨

‍

2. Scalability:

If you want to add a new vehicle type, say Bus, you only need to add the Bus class and update the VehicleFactory class. No changes are needed in the rest of the application. 🔄

‍

3. Encapsulation:

The client code (in Main.java) no longer needs to know how to create the vehicles. The logic is abstracted away in the VehicleFactory class, which makes the system easier to manage. 🗝️
